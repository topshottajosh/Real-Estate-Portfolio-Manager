I've created a Real Estate Portfolio Manager that allows users to enter an infinite amount of real estate properties.
In return, my program can complete three operations:
  1. Add a Property
  2. Display Real Estate Portfolio
  3. Calculate Portfolio's Income
  4. Exit Portfolio Manager
Once the user exits the program, they will be presented with a summary of their portfolio.
